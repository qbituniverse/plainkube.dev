# III. Embed Least Privileged approach

## Only provide enough privileges that are necessary

Before Docker arrived we used to run software on [bare-metal servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-metal_server) or [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) at best. Your host [Operating Systems (OS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) had to be `carefully prepared` with all the dependencies pre-installed. The chances of running multiple applications on the same host, even built on similar stack, were slim due to `dependency clashes` - also known as [Dependency Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell). What's worst these applications often had to operate in an `elevated administrator privilege` context due to its requirements to write to file system or having to open up communication channel on a specific port.

## How containers solve the elevated privileges problem?

You design your application [with containers in mind](/start-thinking-containers) by virtue of adopting Dockerfile declaration for your application. [From the previous chapter](/start-thinking-containers) we know that containerised applications build on top of `Base Images`, such as Core OS ([Windows Server Core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore) or [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)) or a Framework ([.NET Core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) or [Node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)) - which in turn are built on core OS...

> 1. Inside Dockerfile composition stage
> 2. Inside YAML Declaration for Kubernetes Deployments.

## What are my options for the Least Privileged restrictions?

#### Run Container as unprivileged user

This is simply saying `don't run this workload as Administrator`. As result, whoever manages to `exec` into your workload will not be able to cause too much damage other than whatever is in the remit of the `unprivileged user`.

#### Prevent privilege escalation

In addition to the above, you can also explicitly state that `privilege escalation` is to be completely banned inside of the container workload.

#### Add or remove Container capabilities

As with any OS, Docker Container is no exception - it has a number of process running inside. These are defined as `capabilities` and range from opening up ports, firewalls, file system commands or networking. If you container workload doesn't need any of these OS capabilities, you should simply disable them before there get exploited.

#### Limit computer resources available to Container

1. Only assign [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) and [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) levels that are required for the application to function properly - and nothing more.
2. You also prevent your host from [Denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) since both CPU and RAM are capped to a fixed ceiling.

#### Read-only file system

If your container workload is stateless by nature and `doesn't need to modify its file system`, then simply turn it off.
