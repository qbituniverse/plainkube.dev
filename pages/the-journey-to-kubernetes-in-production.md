# XII. The journey to Kubernetes in Production

## Architect it the right way and reap benefits in the future

You've reached the final chapter - well done! At this point, we'll summarise all we've learnt through your `plainkube.dev` journey. Hopefully this document has given you some useful insights into the world of [Docker, Kubernetes and Helm](/docker-kubernetes-and-helm) - which is often referred as [Containerisation](/start-thinking-containers).

Adopting [Docker Containers](https://www.docker.com/) alone is a big undertaking from an enterprise point of view. The chances are that your developers already experiment with this stuff or even run some `low hanging fruit containerised apps` on your infrastructure. However, at an enterprise level you must weigh up few very important concerns.

> On one hand you have the desire to `stay current` and `innovate` - very important survival tactic indeed! 

> On the other hand, you have `infrastructural`, `security` and `general readiness concerns` - which sadly take an awful lot of time for organisational structures to digest and get to terms with regarding `containerisation`.

## So where do the Enterprises start with containerisation?

If the move toward containers started from `within development teams` then you already have an enormous advantage of having the `right people` and `mindset` in place capable of grasping and running the `container technology stack`.

However, if the move toward containers started at `the top` where no or little container interest is present at the `developer` levels then your chances of succeeding are `slim` - unless you `upskill your workforce` or `hire new talent`.

> In both cases - you better make a move quick...

## Is building and running single containers enough?

A simple answer is `no`. If you are `serious` about this tech and more importantly you've actually realised the `benefits` this tech brings then you'll probably venture into the realms of `container orchestration` with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and app `packaging` with [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

> Revisit my `summary` where I explain [Docker, Kubernetes and Helm](/docker-kubernetes-and-helm) as well as what it means to [Start thinking Containers](/start-thinking-containers).

## I'm already running containers, what's next?

Great, you got to the `next stage` in your container evolution. From pure development perspective I'd recommend...

> [Design container-ready development](/design-container-ready-development) as this will make your developers much, much more `productive and agile`.

> [Embed Least Privileged approach](/embed-least-privileged-approach) in `every single` container you produce - however small.

From operational and support perspective I'd suggest...

> [Start early with CICD and Automation](/start-early-with-cicd-and-automation) as this will move your focus to delivering top `quality` software.

> [Invest efforts into Logging and Monitoring](/invest-efforts-into-logging-and-monitoring) will `save` tons of time identifying and fixing issues.

## I'm an architect, do I have anything to say in this?

Oh yes, `you do`... containers bring massive `advantages` to the way you architect your software as well as solutions.

> [Adopt Mesh App and Service Architecture](/adopt-mesh-app-and-service-architecture) to give you agility and `multi-device` reach.

> [API Lifecycle Management is the future](/api-lifecycle-management-is-the-future) which goes hand-in-hand with MASA and `Microservice` adoption.

Finally, `collaborate` with developers, infrastructure, and operations teams and...

> [Consider PlatformOps for delivering software](/consider-platformops-for-delivering-software) so that the `self service` capacity becomes a reality.

## I'm supposed to be leading this, but I have no clue, help me!

Your people, your workforce, `need direction` and `confidence` in the technology they adopt and run with. If you, as leader, `struggle to grasp` this - then you have two choices, `a career change`, or...

> [Cloud-First strategy is the theme of the day](/cloud-first-strategy-is-the-theme-of-the-day) so start `future-proofing` your business before it's too late.

> [Embrace Product-Oriented Delivery model](/embrace-product-oriented-delivery-model) which is probably best thing you can give to your `stakeholders`.

## There's a lot to consider - how did I do it?

If you are still interested in the final picture of how my `Journey to Production with Kubernetes` evolved and you need help with making your `Kubernetes adoption a success`, then...

## Final thought...

Whichever way you approach `containerisation` - just remember:

> `Keep your eyes on the prize` and `persist with your Kubernetes cause`... `it'll pay off`...
